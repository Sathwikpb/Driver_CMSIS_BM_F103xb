# STM32 Drivers Repository (Private - Semperonics Lab)

## Overview
Welcome to the **STM32 Drivers Repository**! This repository contains **bare-metal and HAL-based peripheral drivers** for STM32 microcontrollers, organized systematically for easy navigation and usage. It includes UART, SPI, I2C, and GPIO drivers, with **CMSIS and HAL implementations**, along with test examples and documentation.
